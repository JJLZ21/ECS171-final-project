## Importing to Glitch

Make sure the files in master/main are up to date and use:

`Tools -> Import and Export -> Import from Github`

Use URL: `JJLZ21/ECS171-final-project:glitch`

*Note: this copies the changes that are currently available in the main branch*


## Running locally

First make sure NodeJS is installed and that you can run `npm` from a terminal beforehand.

Make sure all of the dependencies are installed by running `npm install` from a terminal in the current "glitch" folder.

Execute `npm start` to start the server where you can then access the site using the url: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
