Our web interface is hosted on Glitch, a platform that allows users to build and host fast, full-stack web apps in-browser for free.

## How to run the web interface on your local machine

First make sure NodeJS is installed and that you can run `npm` from a terminal beforehand.

Make sure all of the dependencies are installed by running `npm install` from a terminal in the current "glitch" folder.

Execute `npm start` to start the server where you can then access the site using the url: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
