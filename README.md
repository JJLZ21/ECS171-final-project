# ECS171-final-project GROUP 1

This is the github repository of the Fall Quarter 2020 ECS171 Group 1 final project source code. All team members were active contrubuters in code and report writting, and sometimes in areas outside of their primary roles. Group members were generally catigorized based on the following roles: 

_Team Leader_: Mary Hamidi 

_Software Engineering & UI/UX_:  Joel Boersma, Troi-Ryan Stoeffler, Nathaniel Wright, Jack Zhu

_Data Management_: Ninh Nguyen, Marco Lou 

_Machine Learning_: Derek Lee, Shaumik Pathak, Mary Hamidi, Zainab Apalara 

_Project Management_: Zainab Apalara

The goal for this project was to create a product that can help solve the problem small online retailers face when it comes to effective customer-centric marketing using the the data available. Data preparation (such as getting the RFM values), model tuning, and cluster analysis were the most time consuming and critical areas of work. A measure of success for this case study of unsupervised machine learning is the ability to make meaningful inferences of our data and to apply that knowledge to a final product. We were able to successfully implement market segmentation by processing and clustering the data into the right amount of clusters such that there were obvious segments of customer behaviors. Finally, we created a user friendly web interface that can give helpful marketing recommendations.

Web Interface Files: 
  - **public/** is the folder that contains the static files that will be sent to the client
      - **img/** contains the necessary images for the web app
          - **clusterN_new.png** are the plots for clusters 0-3 
      - **react.html** is the static html file that will be sent to the client and will updated by ReactJS
      - **style.css** is the stylesheet for the web app
  - **src/** is the folder that contains the source files for the ReactJS web app
      - **components/** contain the React components for the individual web pages
          - **DataInterface.jsx** is the client HTTP Request interface for communication with the server
          - **Questions.jsx** is the React component for what appears and happens on the Questions page
          - **Results.jsx** is the React component for what appears and happens on the Results page
      - **app.jsx** is the main app file that updates the web page to be the questions or results page
      - **categories.json** is the config file that contains the categories and their appearance for the results page
  - **README.md** contains the instructions to start the webserver locally or on Glitch
  - **package-lock.json** is automatically generated by NodeJS that contains more detailed information for dependencies
  - **package.json** is the configuration for the NodeJS server that tells it what to run and what dependencies there are
  - **server.js** is the code for the express.js server that handles the clustering calculations
  - **webpack.config.js** is the configuration for webpack that compiles everything in src/ into a bundle.js in public/

Machine Learning Files: 
  - **ml_file.ipynb** is the primary source code for the data and machine analysis of the project 
  - **unscaled_ml_file.ipynb** applies some clustering analysis on unscaled data for testing purposes 

Data Set files: 
  - **online_retail_II.xlsx** this the raw dataset coming from the UCI machine learning repository 
  - **processed_dataset_11-18.zip** this is our dataset after pre-processing efforts
