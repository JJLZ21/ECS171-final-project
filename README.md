# ECS171-final-project GROUP 1

This is the github repository of the Fall Quarter 2020 ECS171 Group 1 final project source code. All team members were active contrubuters in code and report writting, and sometimes in areas outside of their primary roles. Group members were generally catigorized based on the following roles: 

_Team Leader_: Mary Hamidi 

_Software Engineering & UI/UX_:  Joel Boersma, Troi-Ryan Stoeffler, Nathaniel Wright, Jack Zhu

_Data Management_: Ninh Nguyen, Marco Lou 

_Machine Learning_: Derek Lee, Shaumik Pathak, Mary Hamidi, Zainab Apalara 

_Project Management_: Zainab Apalara

The goal for this project was to create a product that can help solve the problem small online retailers face when it comes to effective customer-centric marketing using the the data available. Data preparation (such as getting the RFM values), model tuning, and cluster analysis were the most time consuming and critical areas of work. A measure of success for this case study of unsupervised machine learning is the ability to make meaningful inferences of our data and to apply that knowledge to a final product. We were able to successfully implement market segmentation by processing and clustering the data into the right amount of clusters such that there were obvious segments of customer behaviors. Finally, we created a user friendly web interface that can give helpful marketing recommendations.
